Forward stepwise and backward stepwise have path dependence which can result in an early bad selection impacting the quality of the model overall.\n\nWhich of the three models with k predictors has the smallest test RSS?\n\nIt depends, because it is possible that all approaches end up with the same model or the forward and backward stepwise select a better model. Generally speaking, again best subset has the smallest test RSS because it considers every model given the input predictors."
